# Learning Management System (LMS) App

This is a Learning Management System (LMS) built using React, React-Redux, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS. The application features two login systems: Admin and Student. The Admin can add, update, and delete courses and users. To sign up for the application, users need to be invited by the Admin, who can send email invitations to those who wish to participate.
